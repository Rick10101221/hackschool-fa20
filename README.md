# Repository for ACM's Hack School - Learn the MERN - Fall 2020

## Deployment
For starters, you can visit [my pokemon generating website here](https://pokemon-generator-pog.netlify.app) which has its frontend deployed through Netlify and the backend through Heroku.

## Background and Inspiration
I joined ACM's Hack School (launched for the first time in Fall 2020) which aimed to teach younglings the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). It was a ton of fun working on this project and it was super cool seeing it fully-functional.

## What It Does
This project allows you to create your own Pokemon and store it in my MongoDB database. You can draw anything you'd like (keep it family-friendly ofc), name it, give it powers, and even multiple types. I ended up sending the link to a number of my friends, and they created some really sick looking Pokemon (you can view all creating Pokemon by clicking on the 'View Pokemon' tab in the top right of landing page).

## What I Learned
Pretty much the entire MERN stack. I already had prior experience with Express, React, and Node, but it was a blast learning MongoDB and everything else reinforced what I knew, and even taught me a number of helpful tips and tricks!
